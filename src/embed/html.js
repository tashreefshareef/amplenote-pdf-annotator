/**
 * Builds the HTML string returned by `renderEmbed`.
 *
 * The four highlight colors sit as top-level toolbar buttons - the spec is explicit that
 * they must not be a dropdown or a sidebar - and the viewer mounts them from the color
 * table in constants.js so there is one source of truth per color.
 *
 * FOUR FUNCTIONS ARE INJECTED, each by serializing its source:
 *   - `createGeometry()` from src/geometry.js, so the embed runs the SAME rect
 *     arithmetic the Jest suite covers instead of an untested transcription of it
 *   - `createAnnotationWriter()` from src/annotations.js, so Download writes native
 *     PDF annotations with the SAME code Jest exercises against the real pdf-lib
 *     package, not an untested transcription of the pdf-lib spike
 *   - `createExportBuilder()` from src/export.js, so Copy / Send to note / Export all
 *     build the exact markdown Jest checks against the bounty's own layout requirement
 *   - `viewerMain()`, the DOM, PDF.js and pdf-lib wiring
 * None can import anything, and none may contain a literal closing script tag anywhere
 * in its source - comments included. There are tests for all four.
 *
 * SCRIPT LOADING - two live failures are baked into the shape of this file:
 *
 * 1. The viewer must NOT be attached as an `onload="..."` attribute. Its source is full
 *    of double quotes, which terminate the HTML attribute at the first one, so it never
 *    runs at all. The symptom is indistinguishable from a hang: the static "Loading..."
 *    markup just sits there.
 *
 * 2. PDF.js must NOT be a plain `<script src>` here. Amplenote re-executes the embed's
 *    inline scripts immediately while an external script is still downloading, so the
 *    viewer ran before the library existed. The viewer therefore loads PDF.js itself
 *    and waits for onload - the sequence proven to work in the live app.

 * the actual typo. Quoting a property name the way the rest of the codebase does is the
 * natural way to write it and the natural way to break it, so test/source-hazards.test.js
 * asserts the absence rather than trusting review. That guard reads this file as TEXT and
 * imports nothing from it - an assertion living in a suite that imports html.js could
 * never run in the one situation it exists for.
 *
 * A COMMENT IN HERE IS FREE; A COMMENT INSIDE STYLES IS NOT. esbuild strips JS comments
 * from the build, but everything between the backticks is string data and ships verbatim
 * into the plugin note - which has a hard 100k-character cap the bundle is already within
 * a few kB of (see docs/api-notes.md lesson 1). So the long-form rationale for the rules
 * below lives up here, and the CSS keeps only the short pointers.
 *
 * LOOKING NATIVE (all three from one live report - the viewer "not feeling native" beside
 * Amplenote's own editor toolbar, which sits about 30px above it in the note):
 *
 *   - TYPE. Amplenote's UI is Roboto: amplenote.com computes "Roboto, sans-serif" on its
 *     body and the app preloads its own Roboto files. The embed is a separate document,
 *     so the host's copy is not available to it and its asset URL is content-hashed -
 *     hence the webfont link (CDN.robotoCss). The rest of the stack is what a blocked or
 *     slow request falls back to, and is exactly what the font line used to be.
 *
 *   - ICONS. The same app preloads materialicons-latin-400normal.woff2, so its toolbar
 *     glyphs are Material Icons. Ours were typographic characters - a different weight,
 *     optical size and baseline - which is most of what made the bar look bolted on. They
 *     are inline SVG now; see icons.js for why inline rather than the icon font itself.
 *
 *   - THE CARD. The viewer ran to the edges of its box with a single rule under the
 *     toolbar, so nothing marked where the note ended and the embed began - the same
 *     thing that made the highlights panel read as overflow before it was inset. It is a
 *     bordered, rounded card now, the shape every other embed in a note has.
 *
 *     Two rules carry that and both look optional: "overflow: hidden" on the root is what
 *     makes the radius actually clip the toolbar's square corners, and "background:
 *     transparent" on the body is what lets the four corners outside the radius show the
 *     NOTE through the iframe instead of a white notch. The clip does NOT reach the
 *     popovers - they are position:fixed, so only the viewport clips them, and nothing
 *     here establishes a containing block for a fixed element (no transform, filter or
 *     contain anywhere in this stylesheet). Adding one would silently cut the color
 *     picker off at the viewer's edge.

     selection over anything already highlighted.

     Blend mode + isolation live on THIS layer, not on each rect and not per highlight -
     see the comment below for why the scope had to widen twice. DOM order (canvas, then

     Two live reports, same underlying bug, different scope each time:
       1. One highlight's OWN line rects can overlap by a pixel or two - tightly-set
          text can have one line's descender ink dip into the next line's ascender
          space. Fixed first by isolating per HIGHLIGHT (one group per highlight).
       2. That fix left the SAME seam between two DIFFERENT highlights whose rects
          happen to touch at a line boundary (recolor a highlight beside an existing
          one, or two separate highlights on adjacent lines) - each highlight was its
          own isolated group, so two groups touching still each multiplied the page
          independently, compounding right back.
     Isolating the whole layer instead of each highlight fixes both at once: every rect
     on the page composites flat against every other rect first (same or different
     highlight, doesn't matter - two opaque rects overlapping just show whichever
     painted last, no color math), and the FLATTENED result blends against the canvas

     six-item menu hit this: showPopover flips above the cursor when it would overflow
     below, but when the menu is taller than the whole viewport there is nowhere to flip
     to, and it clipped. Scrolling is the only answer that always fits.

     Shadow is softer than it was, to sit with Amplenote's own menus rather than shout
     over them; the border is what carries the edge in dark mode, where a shadow reads as
     nothing at all.

     BOTH axes are named. Setting only overflow-y does not leave the other axis alone:
     CSS computes an "overflow: visible" on one axis to "auto" when the other is not
     visible, so a y-only rule quietly buys an x scrollbar too, and any sub-pixel width
     overflow then draws a horizontal bar across the bottom of the menu. Reported live as

  /* ON-SCREEN SCROLL CONTROLS
     Reported on Android: a drag over the page area scrolls the NOTE, not the pages,
     so the PDF could not be scrolled vertically at all. Horizontal dragging works
     fine, and that asymmetry is the diagnosis - vertical is the host note's own
     scroll axis, so the app claims that gesture (otherwise a full-width embed would
     trap the scroll and you could never get past it), while nothing competes for
     horizontal. That decision is made outside this iframe and no CSS in here can
     take it back: overscroll-behavior on .pdfa-scroll only governs what happens once
     THIS element hits its end, not who owns the gesture to begin with.

     So the answer is a control that does not depend on a gesture at all. Programmatic
     scrolling is untouched by any of the above, which is why the page buttons in the
     toolbar have kept working throughout. Buttons rather than a slider: a slider needs
     precise dragging on a track barely wider than a finger, and has to sit on top of
     the text it is scrolling. */

     Confirmed on a real Android phone running the Amplenote app: embeds DO render

     with the overflow button stranded alone on the third, the exact outcome the
     comment on #pdfa-more says it was grouped left to avoid - and the chrome above
     the pages ended up taller than the strip of page left below it.

     The query is on the EMBED's own width, not the device's. The iframe viewport IS
     the box Amplenote gives us, so "narrow here" already means "this viewer is
     narrow" - and it catches a cramped desktop sidebar too, which a device check
     would miss. */
